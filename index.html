    <p> One of the most pressing issues that dominated New York’s statewide elections earlier this month was crime. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, who was elected into her first full term, and her Republican challenger, Rep. Lee Zeldin, both campaigned on promises of enhancing public safety. </p>

    <p> It was also one of the main issues that drew residents of the South Bronx to come out and vote, many of whom said they were concerned about a rise in shootings in their communities.</p>

    <p> According to the NYPD’s reported shooting incidents, which goes all the way back to 2006 and is available on <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8">  NYC Open Data </a>, shootings in the 40th and 41st precincts of the South Bronx hit a high mark in 2011 with 131 reported shootings (defined as incidents in which people were injured), 28 of which involved homicides. Shootings scaled down throughout the years considerably but then shot back up in 2020 and 2021.</p>

    <p> Marisol Rivera, a program manager with the Bronx chapter of Save Our Streets, a gun violence prevention program, said the pandemic played a huge role in ramping up gun violence. </p>

  <p> “People lost jobs, family members. There was lots of violence, lots of negativity happening in the pandemic,” she said. </p>
